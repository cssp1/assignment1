google/ is the contents of the Google Closure Library (https://github.com/google/closure-library)
plus compiler.jar for the compiler.

SpinPunch customization patches are in this directory.

To update Closure:
1. Unpack new Closure Library files into google/
    - Make a clean copy elsewhere for diffing against!
2. Apply customization patches.
3. If updating the compiler, also replace compiler.jar.
4. Test game and fix any bugs.
5. Re-generate the customization patches by diffing against clean copy.
