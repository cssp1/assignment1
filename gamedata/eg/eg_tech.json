    // 100% Lava shield for use by AIs, to stop their units/buildings from taking damage from the lava climate.
    // We do not have to release this to human players - they might use other ways like equipment or consumable items
    // to mitigate lava damage. This tech is just a convenient way to prevent AI units from taking any lava damage.
