# SpinPunch customized Python libraries

#  Various utilities, mostly related to Twisted and HTTP
git+https://github.com/spinpunch/spin-py-libs.git@v0.1.0#egg=spinlibs==0.1.0

# Twisted==17.9.0 works, but has some spurious warnings and exceptions
# our customized version fixes these.
# note: the version string on the end only tells pip to skip this
# intall if the currently installed version matches that version. It
# does NOT enforce which version is pulled from Git.
git+https://github.com/spinpunch/twisted.git@spinpunch-20.3.0dev1#egg=Twisted==20.3.0.dev1

# note: this might require running pip with the --no-use-pep517 flag
# to avoid errors about "__legacy__"

# ujson MUST be this customized version, which adds extra options like
# buffer size hints and adjusts whitespace handling
git+https://github.com/spinpunch/ultrajson.git@spinpunch#egg=ujson==2.0


# note: if this install fails, it might be because of a legacy setuptools configuration that
# uses HTTP instead of HTTPS to access pypi.python.org.

# To fix this, edit /root/.pydistutils.cfg to contain:
# [easy_install]
# index-url = https://pypi.python.org/simple/

# The below command might also help - "distribute" is a deprecated
# package that may impose bad default settings on pip:
# sudo pip uninstall distribute
